# Glossary-of-Tech-Terms
## Programming Terms ##
* Algorithm: A set of rules/instructions that are used to solve a certain problem, in most cases the algorithm is run by a computer to create a program that will solve a problem.
* Object Oriented Paradigm: A type of coding paradigm, which focuses on the creation of objects within the program that work together to create a solution. This process involves creating classes which acts as a template, an iterance of the class would be called an object. A object has 2 characteristics attributes and methods. Attributes are the features of the object, for example if the object was a cat a attribute could be breed. A method is what the object can do, for example if the object was a dog a method could be fetch.
* Procedural Paradigm: A type of coding paradigm, which focuses on calling upon functions to create a solution. These functions are created by the programmer to solve different parts of the problem.
* Event Driven Paradigm: A type of coding paradigm, in which the flow of the program is decided by events such as user actions.
## The Process of Building an Application
#### Step 1: Build a Development Team (or work alone)
The first step is to make a development team, the people you choose should have some experience in coding as it will increase the effeciency of the actual development stage. Alternatively you can choose to work alone, however the workload will be alot higher.
#### Step 2: Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating sketches for every possible screen/scene in your app. This helps you plan out how your app will work and what interactions will occur i.e a button that brings you to another screen.
#### Step 3: Design
Next you need to create a design document this should include a design of the user interface and your wireframing skecthes with annotations. You also need to discuss the functionality of you app, you should include in this section the purpose of the app, what interactions will be in the app, what limitations will the app have. It is vital that the functionality section is thoroughly thought out as this is what your development team will be using as reference when constructing the app, so any inaccuracies will lead to mistakes in the app.
#### Step 4: Development
This is where you start to code your app, this process can be very time consuming, but can be even more costly when you make mistakes so make sure you have a very clear and detailed plan and design document.
#### Step 5: Testing
Testing is the process of running your app and seeing if it fufills certain criteria i.e testing a button in your app to see if it bring you to the desired screen. You should make sure you test every aspect of your app to ensure that the whole thing works correctly, you can also test during the development stage to remove any surface errors but you should make sure you do detailed testing once the development is perceived as completed.
#### Step 6: launch
Once you are sure your app is working correctly you then need to release it to the public on your chosen platform, however be aware that some app stores require you to make a payment for them to host your app.
#### Step 7: Maintenance
The final step is to continue to listen to user's feedback, this is so you can remove any found bugs and add any highly requested features.
