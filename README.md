# Glossary-of-Tech-Terms
## Programming Terms ##
* Algorithm: A set of rules/instructions that are used to solve a certain problem, in most cases the algorithm is run by a computer to create a program that will solve a problem.
* Object Oriented Paradigm: A type of coding paradigm, which focuses on the creation of objects within the program that work together to create a solution. This process involves creating classes which acts as a template, an iterance of the class would be called an object. A object has 2 characteristics attributes and methods. Attributes are the features of the object, for example if the object was a cat a attribute could be breed. A method is what the object can do, for example if the object was a dog a method could be fetch.
* Procedural Paradigm: A type of coding paradigm, which focuses on calling upon functions to create a solution. These functions are created by the programmer to solve different parts of the problem.
* Event Driven Paradigm: A type of coding paradigm, in which the flow of the program is decided by events such as user actions.
